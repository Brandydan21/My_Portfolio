            <h2 id="topic1">What is the technology? Its purpose/functions? Major points/features?</h2>
            <p>The main purpose of streaming media is entertainment. It can be used to consume media for entertainment, as well as being used for communicating with others.</p>
            <p>It allows for people to watch videos or listen to music without downloading the entire video or song, because it can be streamed as it is being played. Live streaming is a popular part of streaming media, with many different people and groups broadcasting content to a live audience on platforms like Twitch.</p>
            <p>A major feature of streaming media is that it can be accessed from any device that supports it (almost all modern devices), and allows for media to be much more accessible to those with an internet connection than physical media forms. It also does not require downloading or owning a physical copy, which means storage isn&#39;t a problem.</p>
            <p>Streaming media can also be shared around easily because it is usually just a link that others can open to view the same content as you. Streaming media buffers the content, loading and playing it in chunks of data rather than downloading the entire thing first, then playing it back. Streaming media can be flexible, as a faster connection usually allows for a higher resolution to be sent over and more data to be buffered before it gets played back.</p>

        <!-- Who developed it?-->
        <section id="topic">
            <h2 id="topic2">Who developed it?</h2>
            <p>The first ever streaming devices were radios, which transmitted manipulated electrical frequencies between two places without the use of wires. With the help of many physicists, Guglielmo Marconi was able to develop a way to transmit these radio signals in 1895. These signals were generally used for military purposes, transmitting morse code signals.</p>
            <p>It was only in 1920, when U.S Major General George O. Squier found a way to transmit and distribute electrical signals to recreate sounds, allowing for music to be transmitted through electrical wires. Eventually the radio we have today, which transmitted music without the need of wires, the television, as well as the internet and computers were developed, allowing for the streaming of media such as audio, videos and images.</p>
            <p>Since the mid-20th century, people have attempted to display different types of media on computers, from images, audio and videos. However, due to the hardware limitations, as well of the high cost of hardware, streaming content and media was proven very difficult, instead content such as audio and video were usually delivered as a playback from the user&#39;s local hard disk drive. </p>
            <p>In the late 1990s and early 2000, as more users had access to the internet, increased network bandwidth, improvements in computer hardware, combined with increased investments into the internet and its technologies, streaming media was developed and was accessible to users of the internet. </p>
            <p>The first ever live streamed video on the internet was a performance from the band Severe Tire Damage on June 24, 1993. Nowadays, streaming media is used in everyday life, from video conferences such as Zoom, to live streaming content on Twitch or streaming video media from Youtube or TV shows from Netflix.</p>

        <!-- What groups, if any, are responsible managing it?-->
        <section id="topic">
            <h2 id="topic4">Groups responsible for managing it</h2>
            <p>
            Netflix&#39;s streaming service is actually made up of an estimated 700 microservices to control each individual
            Part that makes up the entirety of Netflix&#39;s streaming service. These microservice do all sorts of jobs such as
            Storing shows that a user has watched, conducting transactions with the user and providing the appropriate
            Files so that a user can watch videos. Netflix is responsible for what it displays on their streaming service
            Through devices such as TV&#39;s, iphones and computers. They were founded in 29 August 1997, in Scotts
            Valley, California. Netflix is currently valued at $176.06 Billion Dollars in networth as of Jan 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
            Amazon is another company that are responsible for one of the biggest Streaming Platforms. They had
            Acquired the famous streaming platform known as Twitch, in 2014. A streaming media in which allows
            Anyone to start streaming themselves, and amassing followers. It is a platform focused on live streaming
            But can also store the livestreams as well as recorded clips. Amazon&#39;s responsibility is to ensure that the
            Streaming platform, Twitch, is safe to use and that users follow their community guidelines which are 
            Specified rules and etiquette.
            </p>
            <p>
            Similar to Twitch, the video platform known as Youtube, also allows users to Live Stream on their platform.
            However, it is used much more as a platform for sharing and storing videos. Youtube is currently owned by
            The Tech Giant, Google, in which videos that are uploaded to Youtube are stored in hard drives in
            Google Data-Centers that are of warehouse scale. Google uses a special system that they made known as
            The Google File System which is a distributed developed by Google to manage huge amounts of data in a
            Distributed environment. Google is also responsible for what videos are being uploaded to their platform. 
            Google has guidelines that outline what videos are acceptable on the platform and what are considered
            Illegal. Youtube was founded on the 14th of February, 2005, San Mateo, California, United States.
            </p>
            <p>
            Nearly all video/streaming services nowadays use an algorithm system that controls what users should
            Watch. This is in order to allow their services to become addicting for users so that the companies can gain
            More monetization. The differences between the three mentioned streaming medias is that, Netflix is a streaming
            Service focused on streaming tv series and movies that are most of the time exclusive by contract to Netflix. Twitch,
            Is focused on live streaming media, while Youtube is more of a video sharing platform, in which the videos are
            Uploaded by users and consumed by users.
            </p>
            <p>
            As of current, there is no such group that is responsible for managing every single bit of the defined
            Streaming media. There are multiple million to billion dollar companies that manage their own streaming
            Media, in the form of music streaming, video streaming, live streaming, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
            However, should any of the Streaming Media companies go astray and break their local laws, then it is fair
            to say that their respective government will be responsible for managing that Streaming Media company. 
            Such as, if Youtube starting showing illegal videos that conflicts with the laws in place in Australia, then the
            Australian Federal Government will most likely ban the video streaming platform, Youtube.

        <!-- The Future of Streaming Media. -->
        <aside id="future">
        <h2 id="topic3">The Future of Streaming Media</h2>
        <p>Streaming media has grown significantly over time as the tech gets more advanced and the need for fast paced entertainment grows. Coming from places where music was played from record players to media such as Spotify allowing music to be streamed directly from the users&#39; phones on the go. The technology is constantly evolving to meet the needs of a growing population and audience as these get more common and easy to access.</p>
        <p>An example of this is the increasing number of streaming platforms for movies and shows becoming more popular and more popular slowly replacing TV. This leaves streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ etc, in a place where they are competing with each other to become the most popular and highly sought after. With the pandemic of COVID-19, these services as well as twitch and YouTube grew in popularity due to the higher demand for quick entertainment. This led to more people becoming twitch streamers or youtubers as they were able to spend more time doing things online.</p>
        <p>Technology is constantly advancing and streaming media is not exempt. Streaming media is becoming the norm of our everyday lives as its ease of access and numerous choices provides comfortability and options for the user. Broadcasting will most likely be completely replaced with streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+, as such advertisements will shift to either forcing subscribers to pay more or will continue to be how it is now.</p>

        <!-- What are the related technologies. -->
        <section id="topic">
            <h2 id="topic5">What are related technologies?</h2>
            <p>There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes of videos that viewers watch, we simply only see the surface and the final output from all the action behind the transferring of data and actually streaming that data for viewers to see. Listed below is what a typical setup of video streaming looks like (though it can vary depending on the specific tools you use) from the point of the video content being recorded to the content being viewed from the user end:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The RAW video gets captured by the camera</li>
                <li>The video then gets sent to an encoder</li>
                <li>This will cover the file into a digital file</li>
                <li>Gets ingested into an online video platform</li>
                <li>From there, it then gets distributed to the video player</li>
                <li>Finally, the stream will display on the users device</li>
             </ol>
            <p>To help with creating a seamless streaming experience, different streaming technologies are used to help cater to this, below of which are four major ones that are used. These streaming technologies work together to transmit the video content from point A to point B:</p>
            <dl>
                <li>Streaming protocols</li>
                <li>Codecs (coder-decoder)</li>
                <li>Video players</li>
                <li>Content delivery networks (CDN)</li>
            </dl>
            <h3>Streaming protocols:</h3>
            <p>Throughout the streaming process, the streaming protocols are what helps to carry the contents from one destination to the next and is a standardized method of delivering media across the internet. There are a lot of important streaming protocols that are used but the following ones are the protocols that are more commonly used today: HLS, RTMP, RTSP, MPEG-DASH</p>
            <h3>Codecs:</h3>
            <p>There are two types of codecs, audio and video codecs. Due its bulky state, RAW video files are converted into a digital file through codecs so that it can be streamable to the user. To make sure that it&#39;s easy to transfer the files over the internet, the contents are packed up and compacted before it gets transported from one place to another. <p>
            <h3>Video players:</h3>
            <p>This is the user-facing technology where viewers are able to view the content. Founded by Apple, the HTML5 video player is the standard for most live streaming platforms and can be supported on pretty much any internet-enabled device like smartphones, tablets, etc. In addition to this, it is also compatible with most browsers and operating systems and is very secure and easily customizable.</p>
            <h3>Content delivery networks (CDN)</h3>
            <p>They are servers that are strategically placed over a geographical region to deliver high-quality content to locations that are remote from the stream&#39;s source. The content is sent to a network of servers before redirecting the request from the originating site&#39;s server to the server in the CDN that is closest to the user (upon the user&#39;s desired selection). When the originating point and the destinations are placed closer to each other, the content can be delivered faster.</p>
